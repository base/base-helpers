## History

### v1.0.0

- upgrades dependencies to take advantage of improvements to [load-helpers][] and [helper-cache][]. There shouldn't be any breaking changes here, so if you experience regressions please do not hesitate to [create an issue](../../new).

### v0.2.0

- adds support for passing helper groups as a function. For example, the `log` helper can be a function, but it can also have `log.warning` and `log.info` functions as properties.
